## What is the Liber Maiolichinus?

The **Liber Maiolichinus de Gestis Pisanorum Illustribus**, in English, _Majorcan book of illustrated Pisan acts_.

It is an important book for Catalonia because in this book, **the word Catal√†nia (Catalonia) is used for the first time** to reference Catalonia as a nation.

## What does it explain?

This book explains how the Pisans, Occitans and Catalans allied with the main goal of conquering Mallorca doing expeditions.  

On the other hand, this book explains how in September of the year 1113, **a Pisan fleet was going to make an expedition to Mallorca but due to a storm, they lost their course**. This caused them to end up near Blanes.

## What did the Pisans do in Blanes?

Pisans thought that after the storm they would still be in the Balearic Islands. **The people of Blanes, claimed to be catalans and christians** upon seeing Pisans with their swords and shields ready to fight.

The confused Pisans realized they were in Blanes and they decided to stop.
