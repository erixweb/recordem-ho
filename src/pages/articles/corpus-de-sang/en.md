## Why did it start?

During the **War of 30 Years**‚öîÔ∏è, the king Philip IV of Castileüëë wanted to collect taxes to catalans and recruit them for the war. The problem is that the Catalan Constituion doesn't allow the king to use the resources and population.

In this war, the Castilian troops from the count-duke Olivares were established in the border between France and Catalonia to defend the border.

The Castilian troops, due to the lack of resources to continue on with the war, decided to commit lootings to the local catalan population.

## How did it continue?

The farmers, angried by the situation, revolted as a group.

A thing to be said is that, the Catalan Consitution says that **the Catalan population is allowed to own weapons and defend themselves**

One of the places were the farmers were mostly heard was _Santa Coloma de Farners_. The population didn't allow the Castilian troops to stay.

This had just started. Santa Coloma rang the bellsüîî to gather the farmers armed and kick the Castilian troops.

## Start of _Reapers' War_

The Castilian viceroy, sent to Catalonia by the king Philip IV of Castile, **punished the farmers destroying all the city of Santa Coloma de Farners** together with his army.

**This was just an error**. The voiceroy, wasn't able to see the consequences of destroying the city of Santa Coloma.

The farmers, even more angried, without any flag, shield or anthem, raised a Saint Christ, the 7 of July of 1640, **2.000 farmers proceeded to go to Barcelona** with the goal of taking revenge on the Castilian army.

Without any resistence and with the aid of Barcelonians, they managed to release catalan prisioners jailed by the Castilians. They also **enteded with the life of the voiceroy of Catalonia** (Dalmau III de Queralt) when they considered him a traitor.

The Castilians, when they saw this, they preparated an army with the goal of suffocating the rebellion. Pau Claris, the president of the Generalitat, who chosen as president the year 1638, alarmed by the conquest of the Castilian army, he **proclamated the Catalan Republic** under the protection of the king of France, Lluis XIII.

## Republic of Catalonia and battle of Montju√Øc

After Pau Clari proclamated the Republic of Catalonia under the protection of the king Lluis XIII, the Castilian army, finally recovered, headed to Barcelona.

They managed to conquer Tarragona. However, when they arrived to Montju√Øc, the farmers (**segadors**) and the French army, were face to face against the Castilian army.

The French army, together with the reapers/farmers, **won the decisive battle**

## Death of Pau Claris and the end of the Republic of Catalonia

Pau Claris, who was the **most influential catalan politician**, died the 27 of February after being poisoned by the Castilians.

If that wasn't enough, the king of France, Lluis XIII also died.

During the government of the sucessor of Lluis XIII, Lluix XIV, the **French civil war** had started in 1650, this made a big part of the French troops leave Catalonia.

In the meantime, the Castilian army was lurking important catalan cities.

Finally, with the Treaty of the Pyrenees, French retired their troops from Catalonia in exchange of annexing the Rosellon, Conflent and a part of Cerdanya.
