## What happened before the revenge?

After the _War of Sicilia_, **Roger de Flor founded the Great Catalan Company** in 1303. The Great Catalan Company was a group of mercenaries **which were mainly part of the catalan army (Almog√†vers) and fighters of the War of Sicily**.

The Great Company, **was contracted by the emperor of the Eastern Roman Empire**, Andr√≤nic II, with the goal of kicking out the Turks from the region.

That wasn't an easy task at all, **Turks had almost a three times larger army than the Catalans**. If that wasn't enough, Turks had the best archers.

The Catalan army (Almog√†vers) even though they were clearly in disadventage and with almost no armor, **they were so fast that they avoided the arrows**. They arrived to the defense line and using the war cry of _Desperta Ferro_, the Turks withdrew from all the battles.

And with that, Roger de Flor, captain of the Almog√†vers, **took control of the region of the Anatolia**.

## Why did they take revenge?

As a reward, Roger de Flor, received a **Cesar** title from the Eatern Roman Empire. Nonetheless, **this wasn't aproved by the nobility** as it would mean that the Catalans would have a lot of power inside the empire.

For this reason, the son of the emperor, Miquel, called Roger the Flor to have dinner.
While having dinner, **the emperor and a group of Greeks, killed Roger de Flor and chased Catalans inside the empire**.  

## How did they take revenge?

The Almog√†vers gather together with their new leader, Bernat de Rocafort, in Galipoli. With the intention of proving their braveness, the Almog√†vers burnt their own ships shouting _Cremem les nostres naus!_ and declared the war to the Empire.

Although the empire harassed the city multiple times, the Almog√†vers attacked and destroyed the troops of the empire.

With an absolute victory for the Almog√†vers, **they decide to take revenge harassing, looting and killing all the population** from the current Greece.

Alans, who were also responsible for the murder of Roger de Flor, conscient of what could happen to them, **they killed their own women and children so they weren't killed by the catalans**.

Quote form Bernat de Rocafort:

>> << Kill them. Kill everyone >>
