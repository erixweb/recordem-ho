## What happened before the revenge?

After the _War of Sicilia_, **Roger de Flor founded the Great Catalan Company** in 1303. The Great Catalan Company was a group of mercenaries **which where mainly part of the catalan army (Almog√†vers) and fighters of the War of Sicily**.

The Great Company, **was contracted by the emperor of the Eastern Roman Empire**, Andr√≤nic II, with the goal of kicking out the Turks from the region.

That wasn't an easy task at all, **Turks had almost a three times larger army than the Catalans**. If that wasn't enough, Turks had the best archers.

The Catalan army (Almog√†vers) even though they were clearly in disadventage and with almost no armor, **they were so fast that they avoided the arrows**. They arrived to the defense line and using the war cry of _Desperta Ferro_, the Turks withdrew from all the battles.

And with that, Roger de Flor, captain of the Almog√†vers, **took control of the region of the Anatolia**.

## Why did they take revenge?

As a reward, Roger de Flor, received a **Cesar** title from the Eatern Roman Empire. Nonetheless, **this wasn't aproved by the nobility** as it would mean that the Catalans would have a lot of power inside the empire.

For this reason, the son of the emperor, Miquel, called Roger the Flor to have dinner.
While having dinner, **the emperor and a group of Greeks, killed Roger de Flor and chased Catalans inside the empire**.  

## How did they take revenge?

The Almog√†vers gather together with their new leader, Bernat de Rocafort, in Galipoli. With the intention of proving their braveness, the Almog√†vers burnt their own ships shouting _Cremem les nostres naus!_ and declared the war to the Empire.

Malgrat que l'imperi assetg√®s la ciutat multiples vegades, els almog√†vers sortien i arrasaven les tropes de l'imperi.

Amb una absoluta vict√≤ria per part dels almog√†vers, **decideixen venjar-se arrasant, saquejant i matant a tota la poblaci√≥** de l'actual Gr√®cia.

Els alans, c√≤mplices en l'assesinat de Roger de Flor, conscients del que se'ls vindria, **van matar a les seves pr√≤pies dones i fills amb la fi de que no caiguessin sota mans dels catalans**.

Cita de Bernat de Rocafort:

> > << Mateu-los. A tots. >>

## Paraules que segueixen avui dia per refir-se als catalans.

Avui dia, degut a la brutal venjan√ßa per part dels catalans, a Albania, _"Katallan"_ vol dir **home lleig i dolent**

En Bulgaria, _Catal√†_ o _Fill de Catal√†_ √©s una expressi√≥ per dir **home malvat, sense √†nima i torturador**

D'algunes regions de Gr√®cia arriben refranys com: _"Que et vegi sota l'espassa d'un catal√†"_ o _"El grec es rentava i el catal√† s'emmardava"_
