## Which is the context?

The Spanish War of Succession was a war where the bourbon **Philip V** fought against **Charles of Austria**. This conflict started because **Charles II**, king of Spain, _died without a successor_. 

Thus, _some sort of civil war started_ in which the bourbons, from France, fought against the austriacists. 

## Catalonia's point of view

The catalan people was on the Austrians side as _they defended the freedom of European nations_ while **the bourbons wanted a centralized state**.

## Abolition of the privileges and the Resistance of Catalonia

The bourbons took over the kingdom of Aragon and the kingdom of Valencia. In these territories, Philip V removed the privileges of these regions, **betraying the constitutions that he had sworn to respect**.

Thus, on July 9th of 1713, a proclamation of war was made and the _Siege of Barcelona_ started. The bourbonic troops sieged the city.

## End of the Resistance

Despite the hunger and the fear caused by the bombs, the Barcelonians together with the Austrian allies continued to fight.

The people willing to fight for the Catalan constitutions and for freedom, said _Free or dead_ for the last time on Septemeber 11, 1714 after resisting for more than 1 year. 

Although the general **Antoni de Villaroel** was injured, he continued giving orders to the resistance until he died.

## Fossar de les Moreres

It is in the **Fossar de les Moreres** where **those who fought for the freedom and the Catalan constituions are buried.** 

The red color of the monument representns _the blood spilled for defending Catalonia_.
